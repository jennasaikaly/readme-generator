  ## Installation

  To install the application, the user must clone the repo and then use 'npm install' to download the dependencies into the node_modules folder.

  ## Usage 

  Once the application has been installed, the user can run the app from the command line using 'node index' or 'node index.js'.  They will then be prompted to answer a series of quesions pertaining to their project.  Once they have completed the questions, the README file will be generated in the 'dist'folder.
